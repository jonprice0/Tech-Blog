# Tech Blog #

## Objective ##

>This application is a work in progress. There are a few imoprtant things left to do, including finish additional routes and populate the Handlebars template with Sequelize data. So far I've created the MVC file structure, established a database and configured it's connection to work when deployed to Heroku using JawsDB. I've also begun the main handlebars layout, a User model, user routes and a home route. Additionally, I've added a utility for authorization using express-session. The application needs a lot more work to function as a 'Tech Blog' but I've made a good start with this structure.
